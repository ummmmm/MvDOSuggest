MvDOSuggest
===========

The MvDOSuggest plugin attempts to add functions to the auto-complete dialog based on the MvDO variable path.

Add the plugin to ~/.config/sublime-text-*/Packages/

Once the MvDOSuggest has been added, go to Preferences -> Package Settings -> MvDO Suggest -> Settings -- Default

Set the "path" setting to the directory where the core branch is setup.
